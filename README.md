# Image_Analyzer_Dijkstra_Game
Windows application in which you can upload an image, which will get analyzed by the program and will transform it into an interactive graph to start a simulation. The Simulation consists of little preys (which, to my amusement, are colored after perry the platypus) trying to get to a destination node, while evading hunters in the process.
